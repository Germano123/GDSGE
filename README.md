# GDSGE
**G-Dev Society Game Engine** or **GDSGE** is a project to start learning the concepts of ECS for Game Engines using JavaScript to improve the knowledge with this programming language

## What is a game engine?
A game engine is a software framework primarily designed for the development of video games and generally includes relevant libraries and support programs. You can read more at [Wikipédia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_engine)

## What is ECS?
Entity/Component/System is a software architectural pattern mostly used in video game development for the representation of game world objects. An ECS comprises entities composed from components of data, with systems which operate on entities' components. You can read more at [Wikipédia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system#:~:text=Entity%20component%20system%20(ECS)%20is,which%20operate%20on%20entities'%20components.)

## The core concepts behind this project
I'm studying the core functions to make a good game engine and applying this architecture to study more in deep. In near future I wish to contribute to [MoBaGen]() in order to have a game engine made by our community, Awesome Gamedev Guild.

## The project itself
I'm using JavaScript with Electron to have more knowledge how this techs works. I decided to use them thinking in future plans.
Here are the steps for this projects:
[X] Core game loop
[X] Core ECS
[ ] 
[ ] 
[ ] RTS game
[ ] Chess game

## Contribute
